This code:
1. Monitors voltage from three sources: main, solar, and windmill
2. Automatically switches to the higher voltage source between solar and windmill
3. Includes a safety threshold to ensure minimum voltage before switching
4. Provides manual override through Blynk app
5. Calculates power and energy based on the main voltage and current
6. Implements a switching delay to prevent rapid relay toggling
7. Sends all data to Blynk for monitoring
